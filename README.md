# Advanced ML/AI Implementation Portfolio

## Abstract
This repository contains a systematic exploration of machine learning methodologies across seven critical domains. Each module represents a self-contained implementation with empirical validation, theoretical foundations, and practical considerations.

## Implemented Domains
1. **Unsupervised Pattern Discovery**: Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms
2. **Personalization Systems**: Multi-strategy recommendation frameworks
3. **Natural Language Understanding**: Sentiment classification pipelines
4. **Temporal Forecasting**: Predictive modeling of financial markets
5. **Ensemble Learning**: Advanced tree-based model architectures
6. **Knowledge-Enhanced AI**: RAG systems for information retrieval
7. **Human-AI Interaction**: Prompt engineering methodologies
